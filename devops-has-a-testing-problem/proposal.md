Infrastructure as Code has a Testing Problem
============================================

Testing in the and Infrastructure-as-Code world lags behind pure 
software testing.
This is a problem that can be fixed.

We can and should learn some testing techniques from software developers --
but there are differences that make infrastructure testing a different problem,
and a harder problem, than software testing.
This gives us an opportunity to think about testing in general in some
new ways.

A few things we'll talk about:

* Some horror stories
* The debug cycle in IaC
* Let's test in prod!

At the end of this presentation, attendees should have an idea of:
* Some things that are missing in infrastructure testing
* Some IaC-specific testing techniques
* How we can use infrastructure testing techniques to improve all of our testing.
