CONTRIBUTING TO OPEN SOURCE IN IGNORANCE AND DESPERATION
=====================

I've been using open source software for....

never mind

TCP/IP stack (MS uses BSD's)
the interwebs - BIND, LAMP
OS X (kernel originated in FreeBSD; has parts of GNU userland)
Android (linux kernel)

15 years (consciously)

2 years contributing

'Maintained' - what does it mean?
=====================

commercial:
  'When you change the insides, nobody notices'
  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/25/141253.aspx

oss:
  "It's done"
  Jon 'maddog' hall
  Watch open PR's, not activity. (nawk vs gawk)

What do I get out of it?
=====================

what do I put in?

*money!*
(or supplies)
  you get a book (ssh book for OpenBSD)
  you get a vote (synergy)
  you get support (synergy, pdftk)

but...

complexity
design for amateurs / CTO's
deliberate bugs
change rather than refinement

*bug reports
  maybe the bug gets fixed
  maybe you get support (pdftk offered to run a large job for me)
  maybe you get a workaround (synergy gave me undocumented command line flags)

*documentation
  it's there the next time you need it
  maybe the developer will be more receptive to your gripes after you have 
    contributed

*code*
(but I don't know what I'm doing!)

I DON'T KNOW C

feh - giblib won't compile on cygwin, but there is year-old discussion of 
        importing it
      "That's a low priority"
      refused to merge my brute force fix,
      but then did the work better himself a week later
      You can embarrass developers into doing work you want done!

feh (again) - progress bars print to STDOUT, which is just wrong.
              just went through and switched to STDERR as appropriate
              merged

YOU GET WORKING CODE

afterword - Why git rocks so much for amateurs like me
=====================
cheap forks - anyone can play
cheap merges - it is easy to play
git log & github - it is easier to see the difference between stagnation and 
  perfection
