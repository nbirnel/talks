What's git?
===========
Version control system
Distributed
multi-protocol
Cryptographically secure hashes (later!)
Easy forking, easy merging
Open source, and free as in beer
Not Github

Version Control means never having to say you're sorry 
  lose, revert, find & fix bugs
How I learned to stop worrying and nuked my server
  distributed means you don't need a server
  everyone has their own full complete copy of the whole repo
  You can have a server
  You can use github
  You can just rely on lots replicated repos (linux)
Pick a protocol, any protocol
  http
  https
  git
  filesystem
  torrent
Stop rewriting history
  Each commit is hashed, and named by that hash 
  Each copy of the repo has it's full history.
  If what's in the repo doesn't match the hash, we know something is wrong
Easy forking, easy merging = Easy contribution
  (This is partially a feature of github)
  Thousands of developers on saltstack, not centrally coordinated
Don't fear the future
  OS (and popular) means - it won't be retracted
                           it will keep being maintained
                           it get's ported
git != github
  github provides free (and paid) git serving. 
  They are not behind git. 
  Linus Torvalds started git. There is a git repo on github,
    but it is not where Linus does his merges.
