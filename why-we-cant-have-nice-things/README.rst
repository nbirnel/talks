Bibliography
============

* Sam Harris *On Lying* -- Harris claims that being honest **all of the time**
  is a practical and wise policy. Please note that Harris' thesis here does not
  depend on any of his other unpopular opinions.
* Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin *Expecting Professionalism* 
  https://youtu.be/BSaAMQVq01E?t=1h11m30s -- Martin makes his arguments about 
  the growth of the number of developers.
* Stack Overflow Developer Survey https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#experience --
  You can go back a few years. These numbers are consistent with Martin's,
  but do not prove them: it is a self-selected population.

  Nurse Education, Experience, and the Hospital Context*
