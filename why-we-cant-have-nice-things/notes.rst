Intro
-----

Recap the proposal.

This is a virtuous cycle.

Why do we need these things?

* We're new
* We're stupid
* There is essential complexity

How do you decide
-----------------

* low hanging fruit
  - version control (lots of vc)
  - documentation (and vc) (and onboarding)
  - configuration management
* costs and benefits
* dependancies (graph them!)
* how mature do you need to be?
* MVP: it's not snake oil 

How do you sell it to your fellow engineers
-------------------------------------------

I am really bad at this. What am I doing wrong? Send me a PR!

How do you sell it to your manager
----------------------------------

The 3 Cs

* costs and values
  - Time, equipment, licenses, ongoing costs: present these.
    Let your manager figure out where in the budget these would go.
  - Stories
  - BTW, You *are* a customer. Just not an important one.
* credibility (where do you get it?)
  - Be really good at your job. Sadly, this is not an option.
  - honesty
  - customer oriented
  - show you are not a crow
    + bring a POC
    + bring value
    + We need it for a stack we are already using
    + the time it took me to learn this has already been paid off
* conspiracy (careful with this)
* the 4th C, kindness

You don't need to sell it to your manager
-----------------------------------------

(sometimes)

Two hard problems
-----------------

* Diversity
* Ethics

Start where you are
